Input{.sidebar}
--------------------------

The *instavart dataset* with 1384617 observations and 15 variables gives online order information for 131209 users, who only have single order respectively.

The information focus on the following dimension: 

**firstly**, detailed order information, including order composition(suggested by `product_id`, `product_name`, `aisle_id`, `department_id`, `aisle`, `department`), and order time (accurate to hour, suggested by variables `order_dow`, `order_hour_of_day`);

**secondly**, the usersâ€™ order frequency, which is illustrated by order sequence number for the specific user(suggested by `order_number`) and shopping interval(suggested by `days_since_prior_order`); 

**thirdly**, users shopping preferrence can also be analysed by the order adding to cart and reorder information(suggested by `add_to_cart_order`, `reordered`,respectively).


Column {data-width=550}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Aisle order times rank (for count > 10000).

```{r}
data("instacart")
instacart %>% 
    group_by(aisle) %>% 
    summarise(count=n()) %>%
    filter(count >= 10000) %>% 
    mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle,count,.desc = T))%>% 
   plot_ly(x = ~aisle, y = ~count, color = ~aisle, type = "bar")
```

Column {data-width=450}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Fresh Vegetable order frequency among hours in a day.

```{r}

instacart %>% 
    filter(aisle == "fresh vegetables") %>%
    select(product_name,order_dow,order_hour_of_day) %>% 
    group_by(product_name) %>% 
    mutate(count = n()) %>% 
    ungroup() %>%
    mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(count))) %>% 
    arrange(rank) %>% 
    filter(rank == 1) %>% 
    group_by(product_name,order_hour_of_day,order_dow) %>% 
    summarise(count_per_hour = n()) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    mutate(order_dow = factor(order_dow, levels = 0:6, labels = c("Sun","Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri","Sat")),order_hour_of_day = factor(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
    plot_ly(x = ~order_hour_of_day, y = ~count_per_hour, color = ~order_dow, type = "scatter", mode = "lines" )
```

### Order amount among hours in a day.

```{r}

instacart %>% 
    mutate(order_dow = factor(order_dow, levels = 0:6, labels = c("Sun","Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri","Sat")),order_hour_of_day = factor(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
    select(user_id,order_dow,order_hour_of_day) %>% 
    group_by(user_id) %>% 
    mutate(order_amount = n()) %>% 
    group_by(order_dow,order_hour_of_day) %>% 
    summarise(order_hour_amount = sum(order_amount)) %>% 
    plot_ly(x=~order_hour_of_day, y = ~order_hour_amount,color = ~order_dow,type = "bar")
